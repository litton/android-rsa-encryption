# RSA Encryption app
This app has been created as example to test the encryption of a payload using RSA with padding (OAEP). 

It relies on the embedded [BouncyCastle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/) lib in the Android OS.

The alternative [SpongyCastle](https://rtyley.github.io/spongycastle/) lib, more up-to-date, has been evaluated but discarded due to the considerable jar size.
